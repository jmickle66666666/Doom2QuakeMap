# Doom2QuakeMap
convert doom maps to quake .maps (DEFUNCT, my method won't work)

My original plan of tracing sectors to split disconnected ones and also slice concave sectors didn't account for sectors with holes, and would require a complete rewrite and new plan to fix. As such this project is now defunct.

Edit: APPARENTLY i was somewhat on the right track, actually. My method isn't too far off the process used in GZDoomBuilder, here: https://github.com/m-x-d/GZDoom-Builder/blob/master/Source/Core/Geometry/Triangulation.cs

I may return to this and see if I can get it working.
